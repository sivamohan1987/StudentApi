Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged."},"user2":{"id":2,"name":"Ranjithkumar","username":"ranjith","password":"ranjith@123","profession":"Junior Architect","location":"Bangalore","skills":["HTML5","CSS3","docker","Express JS","Angular JS"],"email":"ranjith@github.com","phone":"9566392626","address":"Pondicherry, India","website":"pranjith.github.com","about":"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source."}}
